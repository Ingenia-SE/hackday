# Hackday D

The purpose of today is the *development of a full application* during the class. This is team work. Small teams will be used for this task. The teams will use a real drone to create a drone system to fulfil a mission. The application will be demonstrated by successful execution of mission.

The objective of the hackday is the development of a drone based application for:

1. Searching a target
2. Imaging the target
3. Notifying the finding

Small teams shall develop an application to fulfil these requirements:

* The application runs on a conventional host -e.g. Windows or Linux.
* The application will communicate with a Parrot Minidrone to control it.
* The application is used to manually pilot the drone; the operator will only use the resources of a common * computer -mouse, keyboard, screen- to operate a drone in a search task. 
* The operator will pilot the drone to find an object.
* The operator will use the drone to get an image of the object.
* The application will mark the object inside the image.
* The operator sends the image to a remote server to communicate the finding. The source code of the server will be available.
