# Hackday V

Development of a virtual system.

## Objective

The objective of Hackday V is the development of a simple control application using a drone simulator to emulate the MBZIRC 2020 firefight challenge.
This application will be demonstrated by capturing a video of a simulated drone acting on a fire in a building structure.

## Goals

* The system shall simulate the MBZIRC challenge of a drone fighting a fire in a building.
* The team shall use the system to produce a video showing the simulated firefighting.

## Requirements (partial; see the model)

* The application runs on a conventional host -e.g. Windows or Linux or OSX or Android or iOS.
* The application will communicate with a simulated drone to control it.
* The application is used to pilot the drone; automatically and/or manually.
* The human pilot may use the UI resources of a common computer -mouse, keyboard, screen- to operate the drone in addition to the automatic control by the application. 

## Milestones

* Simulate the drone. 2/1
* Simulate building with fire. 2/1
* Fly the simulated drone. 2/1
* Fly the drone using the app. 2/1
* Capture video. 2/1
* Capture MBZIRC-like video. 2/1
* Upload code, model and video to git Hackday V repository. 10/5
