# Hackday E

The purpose of today is the *development of a full application* during the class. This is team work. *New* small teams will be used for this task. The teams will use an embedded computer to create a system to fulfil a mission. 

The purpose of today is the development of an embedded application during the class. The teams will use a specific embedded platform as target. Any computer can be used as host. The application will be demonstrated by successful execution of mission.

The objective is the development of an embedded application for Morse messaging using two LEDs in the target board. The application will:

* Let the user specify a MESSAGE in a computer (the host).
* Upload the message into an embedded computer (the target).
* Download the message from the target.
* Start/Stop from the host the display of the message in Morse by the target.
